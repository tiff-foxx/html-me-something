      <h2 class ="place">London, England</h2>
        <p>London is a cosmopolitan city with people from every corner of the world (you can thank the British Empire for that). 
                The story of Henry VII and Anne Boelyn never gets old. I love the history there.</p>
      <img src="images/Istanbul.jpg"/>          
      <a name="Istanbul, Turkey"></a>
      <h2 class="place">Istanbul, Turkey</h2>  
        <p>Istanbul is a beautiful modern city that has not lost touch with the past. The city features a varied past. The religions of it's conquerers 
                can be seen throught the city's architecture. The &euro; was not used here. The Turkish Lira was instead.</p>
      <img src="images/New Delhi.jpg"/>
      <a name="New Delhi, India"></a>          
      <h2 class="place">New Delhi, India</h2>
        <p>New Delhi was my first stop in India, but I also made it to Agra and Jaipur. This is easily one of the most intriguing and beautiful countries
                I've visited. The environment is harsh, but it's a small price to pay in exchange for the grandeur that is India.</p>
      <img src="images/Athens.jpg"/>
      <a name="Athens, Greece"></a>
      <h2 class="place">Athens, Greece</h2>
        <p>Athens was bursting with history, great food, and great people. While it was very hot I enjoyed visting the ancient sites and wondering whose
            footsteps had also crossed the paths that I was walking in this old, old city.</p>
      <img src="images/Tokyo.jpg"/>
      <a name="Tokyo, Japan"></a>          
      <h2 class="place" id="winner">Tokyo, Japan</h2>
        <p>Tokyo is a place I've wanted to visit since middle school. I will never get tired of this place and hope to have a home here one day. Tokyo is
                something indescribable. You'll have to go there yourself. </p>
